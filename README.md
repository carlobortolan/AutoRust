A simple Autograd engine written in Rust that implements backpropagation (reverse-mode autodiff) over a dynamically
built DAG and a small neural networks library with a PyTorch-like API. The DAG only operates over scalar values.
However, this is enough to build up entire deep neural nets doing binary classification, as the demo notebook shows.

<!-- ## Installation

```bash
cargo install autorust
```
-->

## Example usage

> [!NOTE]
Check out [/demo](./demo) for more detailed examples.

## Training a neural net

// TODO

The file `demo/demo.rs` provides a full demo of training a 2-layer neural network (MLP) binary classifier. This is
achieved by initializing a neural net from `autorust::mlp` module, implementing a simple svm "max-margin" binary
classification loss and using SGD for optimization.

## Running tests

Simply run:

```bash
cargo test
```

> __Additional info__: _This is inspired
by [pytorch's autograd engine](https://pytorch.org/blog/overview-of-pytorch-autograd-engine) as well
as [micrograd](https://github.com/karpathy/micrograd) and used for experimenting with Rust and the concept of autograd
engines and neural nets._
